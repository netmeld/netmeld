DESCRIPTION
===========

This module provides a set of tools to aid an analyst in various
aspects of network scanning type activities for a system assessment.
The behavior of the majority of these tools is around configuration and
orchestration rather than doing the actual work of scanning.

PLAYBOOK FUNDAMENTALS
=====================

INTRA-NETWORK VS INTER-NETWORK
------------------------------

Intra-network scans are constrained to the broadcast domains
of directly connected networks (physical or VLAN).
Routers are not used during intra-network scans.
Intra-network scans typically provide the best data about
active hosts (ARP is almost never blocked) and
network reachable services (only host-based firewall rules are encountered).
Intra-network scans provide one good set of data fairly quickly.

Inter-network scans will try to route through various routers or firewalls
attempting to reach devices and services in other networks.
Inter-network scans frequently must contend with restrictive firewalls,
load-balancers, and other network devices that block or shape traffic.
Inter-network scans provide another good set of data more slowly
that can then be compared to intra-network scans to better validate
and characterize the performance of network security devices.


STAGES
------

A stage is a physical configuration that requires a human assessor to change
the physical network connections or location of the assessment computer.
Within a single stage, the assessment computer can run scans in parallel
or automatically start the next scan in a series.

For example:

* **In stage 1**, assume that the assessment computer is connected
  to a trunk port on switch 1.  The playbook can automatically run scans,
  in parallel or in series, on each VLAN in that switch 1 trunk.
* Between stage 1 and stage 2, the assessor needs to physically disconnect
  the assessment computer from switch 1, move it to another equipment rack,
  and physically connect it to a trunk port on switch 2.
* **In stage 2**, the playbook can automatically run scans,
  in parallel or in series, on each VLAN in that switch 2 trunk.
* Between stage 2 and stage 3, the assessor needs to physically disconnect
  the assessment computer from switch 2, move it to the location of server 1,
  disconnect server 1 from the network, and connect the assessment computer
  in place of server 1.
* **In stage 3**, the playbook can automatically run scans,
  in parallel or in series, from the network perspective of server 1.


PHASES
------

A phase is a logical grouping of commands which will execute in series or
parallel within a stage.  Activities within a phase may feed data, via the data
store, into other phases for that stage.  Phases are currently limited to being
used for containing optional units of work within a stage.  As such, not all
commands are located under a phase (e.g. interface set up and tear down).  The
expectation is intensity, complexity, and *cost* of activities typically
increase through phase progression.


COMMANDS
--------

A command is a singular unit of work within the playbook.  Ultimately, this
will be the smallest logical unit of work.  Typically this translates to a
singular command for the host to execute, but may be a set of associated or
highly inter-dependent commands.


PLAYBOOK WORKFLOW
=================

The following graphic provides a general overview of the workflow and tools
involved to leverage the playbook for scanning activities.

![](docs/netmeld-playbook-workflow.png)

We typically create a script to both automate and document, in more than one
place, the activity for the playbook.  The aim is to make it simple and
understandable so it is suggested to create a singular script per stage.  See
the example [playbook-script](playbook-script.sh) for a generalized start
point.  The below discuses a topic which is not covered by a specific tool.


DEFINE SCOPE (IN/OUT)
---------------------
Abiding by what is in or out of scope, the Rules of Engagement (ROE), is very
important during an assessment.  Thus, the Playbook tools will honor the scope
defined in the data store.

Currently, the `psql` tool is utilized to manipulate the ROE within the data
store.  For example:
* Assume that the ROE authorizes the assessment team to target the IP address
  space 10.1.1.0/24 and 192.168.0.0/16 at the customer site;
  however, the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 is off-limits for any number of reasons.
```
#!/bin/bash

DB_NAME=site

psql ${DB_NAME} -c "INSERT INTO playbook_roe_ip_nets VALUES ('10.1.1.0/24', true)"
psql ${DB_NAME} -c "INSERT INTO playbook_roe_ip_nets VALUES ('192.168.0.0/16', true)"
psql ${DB_NAME} -c "INSERT INTO playbook_roe_ip_nets VALUES ('192.168.2.0/24', false)"
```
  A value of `true` in the second column means that the addresses are in-scope,
  while a value of `false` means that the addresses are out-of-scope.
  The values in the `playbook_roe_ip_nets` database table are used to generate
  target lists and exclude lists for tools such as Nmap.
