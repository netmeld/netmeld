==========
- Update this README with useful info
- Figure out tool naming and placement (maybe this works)
- Use YAML for config/query similar to Playbook module
- Pre-populate with some queries/commands; e.g.,
  - Common things flagged in the DB or via tooling already (ToolObservations)
  - Useful views of data (reachability matrices)
