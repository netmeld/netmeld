GRAPHERS
========

The `nmdb-graph-*` tools provide a means to generate Graphviz `.dot` format
output based on information currently in the Netmeld data store.  Generally
the output is targeted for the Graphviz `dot` tool, however you can use
any Graphviz layout programs as appropriate (such as `neato`, `fdp`,
or `sfdp`).  You can also redirect the output from the tools to a file
and use any other graphing tools that can process Graphviz `.dot` format.
