DESCRIPTION
===========

The `nmdl-initialize` tool is utilized to initialize the data lake to an empty,
default state.  This is destructive; meaning any previous data will be lost.


EXAMPLES
========

Initialize a targeted data lake type, `git`, to its default state.
```
nmdl-initialize --lake-type git
```
