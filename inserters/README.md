# The Insert Tools

The `nmdb-insert-*` tools are for manually inserting information
that is obtained from system documentation, interviews with system
designers or owners, or from reviewing configuration files for which
we don't yet have import parsers.

Since the `nmdb-insert-*` tools are for manually inserting information,
all of the tools default to using `human` for the data path.  If pedigree is
wanted it currently has to occur externally to the data store.
